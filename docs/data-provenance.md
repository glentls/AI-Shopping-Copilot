# Data provenance and integrity

The frozen 50,000-row catalog is derived from the Amazon Reviews 2023
`Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry` category and joined on `parent_asin`. It is a
release asset rather than a Git-tracked file.

Setup verifies the organizer-published checksum of `catalog.jsonl.gz` before
decompression. The participant-kit release values verified on 2026-08-29 are:

```text
catalog.jsonl.gz  07fd142631fd6b03e2b4d09988c3eb7d53720e9d57010c79db48eeaada50a8f8
catalog.jsonl     da979b05a68af864cb0dcf9ee6a81c010c7e66a57978ad286c7a2e005fc69a67
rows              50000
```

At runtime, the Agent automatically verifies these decompressed bytes whenever
the official default path is used. `SHOPLENS_CATALOG_SHA256` enables the same
check for a custom path; the official path has no bypass. Loading fails on a checksum mismatch, a missing
identifier, or a duplicate identifier. The loader exposes immutable product
records and the system never writes to the catalog.

The released public set contains 200 labeled development sessions. The local
ablation runner creates its deterministic stratified 120/80 split without
editing that source file. Reportable runs pin its SHA-256 to
`857259f7a438e6188ac63e18995b6ff4489bfcfc4a716a798b9a2aa0ee8f7579`,
evaluate private immutable input snapshots, and rebuild dense vectors from the
verified vendored model in-process.

## Research-derived methods

ShopLens's planned tri-state preference and catalog-aware dialogue-policy
experiments are informed by Li et al.'s TRACER method. They are independent
implementations against the competition's immutable Amazon Reviews 2023
catalog; no upstream TRACER source files or WoS dataset records are part of the
data pipeline. See the
[Wizard of Shopping source audit](wizard-of-shopping-integration.md) for the
canonical citation, license evidence, adoption decisions, and future generated
artifact metadata requirements.

Clarification-quality and evaluation-reporting guards are additionally
informed by Ye et al.'s ProductAgent (arXiv:2407.00942). No ProductAgent
source file and no AliMe KG record is part of the data pipeline; that corpus
sits outside the Amazon Reviews 2023 competition package and carries no
verified dataset license. The paper itself is under the arXiv non-exclusive
distribution license 1.0, so no copy or conversion of it is tracked. See the
[ProductAgent source audit](productagent-integration.md) for the license
finding and the adoption boundary.
