# TechJam Conversational E-Commerce Search Challenge

Build an AI shopping agent that asks useful follow-up questions and recommends the customer's hidden target product within at most 10 turns.

## What You Receive

- A frozen catalog of 50,000 products from the `Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry` category of Amazon Reviews 2023.
- 200 labeled public sessions for local development.
- A weak BM25 starter agent and deterministic local evaluator.
- The Agent API contract and scoring rules.

The organizer keeps 800 additional sessions unreleased until the Devpost submission deadline. After the deadline, the final evaluation package will be released and teams will run the unmodified official evaluator in their own environments using their frozen submitted commit.

See [`docs/final_evaluation_faq.md`](docs/final_evaluation_faq.md) for the final evaluation, network, credentials, hardware, data, and scoring policy.

## Task

For each session, your agent receives an anonymized preference profile and a short customer message. Raw user IDs, review text, timestamps, and purchase history are never disclosed. On every turn the agent may:

- ask a natural clarification question in `message` and identify one requested field in `ask_attribute`;
- return a ranked list of up to 10 catalog `parent_asin` values;
- do both in the same response.

The session ends when the target product appears in the scored Top 10 or after turn 10. Sessions cover Buying, Browsing, Intent Override, and Boundary behavior.

## Download the Catalog

Download `catalog.jsonl.gz` from the GitHub Release attached to this repository, then run:

```bash
gzip -dk catalog.jsonl.gz
mv catalog.jsonl data/catalog.jsonl
```

Verify the downloaded file using the published `SHA256SUMS` file.

## Run the Starter

Python 3.10 or later is recommended. The starter uses only the Python standard library.

```bash
python3 -m evaluator.local_evaluator
```

The Agent implementation is in `starter/`. Do not edit the evaluator or public labels when reporting your local score.
The command writes per-session results and aggregate metrics to `results.json`.

The included weak BM25 starter scores Hit Rate@10 `0.125`, MRR `0.068034`, and
MTTC `9.81` on the released public set. See `docs/baseline_results.json`.

## Implemented Agent

This repository now includes a stateful, offline-first conversational search
agent. It uses only the Python standard library and requires no API key, model
download, or network access during evaluation.

The pipeline has six stages:

1. `starter.dialogue.SessionState` turns each message into weighted positive
   evidence, tracks requested attributes, ignores explicit no-preference
   answers, and removes superseded opening preferences on intent override.
2. `starter.retrieval.CatalogSearch` generates candidates through accumulated
   keyword, exact-phrase, and category routes using a weighted SQLite FTS5
   index.
3. Reciprocal-rank fusion combines the routes without assuming their raw
   scores are calibrated.
4. A deterministic reranker scores constraint coverage, exact metadata
   phrases, budget proximity, a small aggregate-profile match, and a
   log-scaled product-popularity prior. Product text is normalized once on
   first retrieval and retained in a bounded 5,000-entry LRU feature cache;
   query evidence is compiled once per turn and reused for every candidate.
5. An adaptive question planner measures how much the live candidates differ
   across material, colour, size, style, use case, price, brand, category, and
   features. It selects the facet with the greatest estimated information gain
   and generates the question from observed candidate values. There is no
   fixed question order or per-attribute question-text dictionary.
6. An immutable recommendation policy stages output breadth as confidence
   accumulates: one result on turns 1-2, up to three on turn 3, and up to the
   requested Top-K afterward. The schedule is runtime configuration and never
   reads evaluator scenario labels or target identifiers.

The current public-set results are:

| Agent | Hit Rate@10 | MRR | MTTC | Efficiency | TechnicalScore |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Released BM25 baseline | 0.125 | 0.068034 | 9.81 | 0.119 | 0.106710 |
| Stateful adaptive multi-route agent | **0.990** | **0.932181** | **2.275** | **0.8725** | **0.949154** |

Scenario Hit Rate@10 is `0.9875` for Buying, `0.966667` for Intent Override,
and `1.0` for Browsing and Boundary. These are development-set measurements,
not estimates of the private leaderboard score. The method does not memorize
public target identifiers; public labels are used only by the evaluator and
optional diagnostic script.

### Reproduce the Results

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python -m evaluator.local_evaluator
```

### Optional Semantic Vector Route

The evaluated default is deterministic and offline: it does not construct a
vector index or call an embedding API. The retrieval pipeline can optionally
add exact in-memory cosine search over normalized OpenAI catalog embeddings.
Generate the local artifact once with:

```bash
python -m scripts.generate_catalog_embeddings
```

Then opt into the experiment explicitly:

```python
from starter.agent import Agent
from starter.config import AgentConfig

agent = Agent(config=AgentConfig(enable_vector_reranker=True))
```

The command uses `text-embedding-3-small` with 256 dimensions, resumes from a
completed batch after interruption, and writes an ignored approximately 49 MiB
`data/catalog_embeddings.npy` file plus checked metadata. At runtime, active
intent is filtered and rendered as one structured category/features/use-case
query and embedded once. Raw cosine similarity can then make a capped adjustment
among close lexical candidates only when calibrated similarity and margin gates
pass and the candidate matches the requested category. Exact hard-constraint
matches and lexical leads larger than the semantic cap are protected.
Category-only or still-exploring queries skip the vector route.
`OPENAI_API_KEY` may be supplied through
the environment or an ignored `.env` file; the existing `OPENAI_APIKEY` alias
is also accepted for compatibility. If credentials, network access, or
the validated artifact are unavailable, the agent continues with its existing
offline retrieval routes.

On hosts where Python 3.13 rejects an older enterprise CA solely because its
Basic Constraints extension is not marked critical, set
`OPENAI_SYSTEM_CA_COMPAT=1`. This retains certificate-chain and hostname
verification while disabling only Python's X.509 strict compatibility flag.

The checked calibration artifact is `docs/vector_gate_calibration.json`. It can
be regenerated without running the evaluator:

```bash
python -m scripts.calibrate_vector_gates
```

For a turn-by-turn inspection of one labelled development session:

```bash
python -m scripts.analyze_session public_0053
```

The diagnostic script is development-only and is not imported by the Agent.

### Cost, Latency, and Limitations

- Model/API cost and reported token usage are zero. The evaluated path is
  deterministic and standard-library-only.
- On the development machine with Python 3.13.5, building the 50,000-product
  in-memory index took approximately 3.9 seconds. A ten-turn benchmark averaged
  approximately 172 ms per response with adaptive question analysis. On a
  deterministic 20-session slice, a 5,000-product feature cache reduced
  evaluation time from 12.654 seconds with effectively no reuse to 9.220
  seconds, a 27.1% reduction with identical metrics. These measurements are
  hardware-dependent.
- The released simulator reveals constraints copied from catalog metadata, so
  exact phrases are especially informative. More varied real customer language
  would benefit from an optional local semantic-retrieval route.
- Very broad categories paired only with generic attributes can remain
  intrinsically ambiguous. The public run misses two sessions, and private
  performance may be lower than the development score.
- The popularity feature is log-scaled and subordinate to textual constraints,
  but it can still favor established products when several candidates are
  otherwise indistinguishable.

## Agent Interface

```python
class Agent:
    def reset(self, session_id: str, user_profile: dict) -> None:
        ...

    def respond(self, session_id: str, user_message: str, turn: int, top_k: int) -> dict:
        return {
            "message": "Do you have a material preference?",
            "ask_attribute": "material",
            "recommendations": [
                {"parent_asin": "B000..."},
                {"parent_asin": "B001..."}
            ],
            "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 120, "completion_tokens": 30}
        }
```

`ask_attribute` is one of `category`, `material`, `color`, `size`, `style`, `brand`, `budget`, `feature`, `use_case`, `other`, or `null`. See `docs/agent_api_contract.json`.

## Technical Metrics

- **Hit Rate@10:** fraction of sessions that find the target within 10 turns.
- **MRR:** mean reciprocal rank of the target; a miss contributes zero.
- **MTTC:** mean first-hit turn; a miss is assigned turn 11.
- **Reported token usage:** prompt and completion tokens returned by the team's model client.

```text
TechnicalScore = 0.50 × HitRate@10 + 0.30 × MRR + 0.20 × Efficiency
Efficiency = clip((11 - MTTC) / 10, 0, 1)
```

`TechnicalScore` is an objective input to the `Technical Execution` assessment. It is not a separate judging criterion and does not represent the entire `Technical Execution` score.

Only exact `parent_asin` equality produces a hit. Core metrics are also reported by scenario.

## Model Choice and Cost

Teams may use any legally accessible LLM API or local model. Teams manage their own credentials and must never commit API keys. Model choice, estimated cost, token usage, and latency must be disclosed. Token usage is a feasibility metric, not part of the core technical score. The organizer does not provide or reimburse model API credits; teams are responsible for any costs incurred through optional external services.
