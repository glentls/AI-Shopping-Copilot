# ShopLens

ShopLens is a deterministic, offline-first conversational shopping agent for
the TechJam 2026 conversational-search challenge. It asks a clarification on
the same turn that it returns up to ten ranked products, remembers disclosed
constraints, and removes superseded preferences when the shopper changes
their mind.

The planned extension of its preference and clarification policy is informed
by Li et al.'s TRACER method from *Wizard of Shopping* (ACL 2025). ShopLens is
an independent implementation and currently contains neither upstream TRACER
code nor Wizard of Shopping dataset records. The
[source audit and adoption boundary](docs/wizard-of-shopping-integration.md)
records the full citation, license evidence, and adopt/evaluate/defer decisions.

The system implements the organizer's `Agent.reset(...)` and
`Agent.respond(...)` interface. It does not modify the catalog or evaluator,
call a paid API, or require network access during baseline scoring.

```

The implementation is split by responsibility:

- `src/contracts/`: shared response, state, parsing, retrieval, and run config contracts.
- `src/catalog/`: immutable JSONL loading, normalization, and checksum verification.
- `src/parsing/` and `src/state/`: controlled-language parsing, slot transitions, and query construction.
- `src/retrieval/`: weighted FTS5 BM25, optional local dense retrieval, and reciprocal-rank fusion.
- `src/scoring/`: bounded non-filtering constraint evidence, dynamic routes,
  and membership-preserving phrase-rarity reranking.
- `src/policy/`: candidate-facet information gain plus an experimental
  expected-question-value mode, with targeted fallback and persistent
  per-attribute decline handling.
- `src/agent.py`: integration and last-non-empty/global failure recovery.
- `agent.py` and `starter/agent.py`: thin shims for submission and the organizer's local evaluator.

Hard constraints are penalties, never filters. A parsing mistake can lower a
candidate but cannot delete the target from the retrieval pool. Query text is
built from active slots only. Same-attribute disclosures accumulate, while a
genuine override such as “black, then actually brown” retires superseded soft
evidence without erasing unrelated constraints.

## Requirements and setup

- Python 3.10 or newer (tested here with Python 3.12).
- SQLite compiled with FTS5, as in standard CPython distributions.
- No Python packages are required for config A, the deterministic BM25 baseline.
- Hybrid/dense configs require `numpy`, `sentence-transformers`, and the
  locally vendored `models/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/` directory.

Download the release assets `catalog.jsonl.gz` and `SHA256SUMS`, verify the
compressed asset, and place the decompressed file at `data/catalog.jsonl`:

```bash
sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS
gzip -dk catalog.jsonl.gz
mv catalog.jsonl data/catalog.jsonl
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python3 -m pytest -q
```

Install the portable optional dependencies before running hybrid configs:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dense.txt
```

Reportable dense evidence uses the fully resolved reference environment on
CPython 3.12, Linux x86-64:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dense.lock.txt
```

`pip` is the canonical path and requires no tooling beyond the standard
library. If [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is available it installs the
same lock substantially faster, and the resulting environment is equivalent:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv-dense
uv pip install --python .venv-dense/bin/python -r requirements-dense.lock.txt
```

Both routes resolve to the identical package set, so `requirements_lock_sha256`
and `requirements_lock_mismatches` in reportable evidence are unchanged. uv is
an optional convenience; it is never required to reproduce results.

The default `data/catalog.jsonl` path automatically verifies the pinned
decompressed release digest. For a custom catalog path, request the same
load-time protection by setting its digest:

```bash
export SHOPLENS_CATALOG_SHA256="$(sha256sum data/catalog.jsonl | cut -d' ' -f1)"
```

The default and repository-absolute catalog paths always enforce the official
digest. For fixture diagnostics, pass a custom path and its explicit checksum;
there is no verification bypass for the official path.

The repository deliberately loads dense and reranker models by local path,
never by model name. The embedding model is pinned and documented in
`models/README.md`. Dense catalog embeddings are computed locally and may be
persisted as the ignored file `data/catalog.embeddings.npz`. Normal agent use
can reuse a validated cache. A reportable run instead rebuilds vectors from
the pinned model and an immutable catalog snapshot in-process. If local model
files or optional packages are unavailable, normal hybrid use falls back to
deterministic BM25 without a network request; the evidence runner marks that
capability mismatch non-reportable.

## Reproduce evaluation

Run all 200 public sessions. `SHOPLENS_CONFIG` unset selects the submission
configuration T, so a bare run reproduces what the official harness grades.
Without the optional dense dependencies T degrades to the deterministic BM25
route rather than failing:

```bash
python3 -m evaluator.local_evaluator
```

Name any other ablation explicitly, for example the standard-library baseline A
or the conservative clean-holdout candidate P:

```bash
SHOPLENS_CONFIG=A python3 -m evaluator.local_evaluator
SHOPLENS_CONFIG=P python3 -m evaluator.local_evaluator
```

Run the stratified 120-session dev or 80-session holdout split and append the
config, scores, split, and Git SHA to `results.jsonl`:

```bash
python3 -m src.eval.runner --config P --split dev
python3 -m src.eval.runner --config P --split holdout
```

The canonical runner requires a clean tree and writes only reportable evidence
to `results.jsonl`. Dirty diagnostics must use a path outside the repository:

```bash
python3 -m src.eval.runner --config P --split dev \
  --allow-dirty --results-log /tmp/shoplens-p-dev.jsonl
```

The public organizer starter (which does not ask clarification questions)
reports HR@10 `0.125`, MRR `0.068034`, MTTC `9.81`, and TechnicalScore
`0.10671`. Config A is an honest BM25 baseline with clarification enabled and
is therefore not directly comparable.

Reportable results are generated by `src.eval.runner` only from an identifiable
clean implementation whose requested local capabilities actually loaded and
whose guarded response fallback handled no unexpected exceptions. The runner
records those capability checks and fallback count alongside config flags,
locked dependencies, platform, pinned model and vector digests, catalog and
dataset digests, cache provenance, latency, memory, and four Git-state gates.
Dev and holdout use the deterministic stratified 120/80 split.

### Historical reportable baseline

The following rows come from clean commit `be4017aa` in `results.jsonl`.
All A–F rows report zero guarded exceptions; B–F confirm that hybrid retrieval
loaded rather than using the BM25 fallback. Higher HR@10, MRR, and Score are
better; lower MTTC is better.

| Config | Dev HR@10 | Dev MRR | Dev MTTC | Dev Score | Holdout HR@10 | Holdout MRR | Holdout MTTC | Holdout Score |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| A | 0.7167 | 0.4687 | 5.1417 | 0.6161 | 0.7500 | 0.4435 | 4.9375 | 0.6293 |
| B | 0.6417 | 0.3185 | 5.6167 | 0.5241 | 0.6500 | 0.3137 | 5.6375 | 0.5264 |
| C | 0.8250 | 0.4567 | 4.0000 | 0.6895 | 0.8375 | 0.5027 | 4.1125 | 0.7073 |
| D | 0.7250 | 0.4296 | 4.7583 | 0.6162 | 0.7500 | 0.4723 | 4.9625 | 0.6374 |
| E | 0.8250 | 0.4567 | 4.0000 | 0.6895 | 0.8375 | 0.5027 | 4.1125 | 0.7073 |
| **F** | **0.8417** | **0.5027** | **3.9500** | **0.7127** | **0.8500** | **0.5158** | **4.0125** | **0.7195** |

F was the retained dense configuration at that commit. D shows that removing
session memory regressed both; E's historical tie with C predates the live
facet-based information-gain policy. B also shows that dense fusion alone is
not sufficient. Config Z, the diagnostic
no-clarification run over all 200 sessions, scores only `0.192606` with MTTC
`8.895`, demonstrating the cost of stalled disclosure.

F's per-scenario evidence is reported explicitly because aggregate gains can
hide override failures:

| Scenario | Dev HR@10 | Dev MRR | Dev MTTC | Holdout HR@10 | Holdout MRR | Holdout MTTC |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Boundary | 0.1667 | 0.0417 | 9.6667 | 0.2500 | 0.0250 | 8.5000 |
| Browsing | 0.8958 | 0.5141 | 3.4792 | 0.8750 | 0.6332 | 3.9375 |
| Buying | 0.9375 | 0.5937 | 2.8125 | 0.8750 | 0.4288 | 3.2500 |
| Intent Override | 0.6667 | 0.3836 | 6.3333 | 0.9167 | 0.5980 | 4.7500 |

### Accuracy candidate validation

Every candidate below was frozen after dev-only tuning and opened on holdout at
most once, under a retention gate registered before the run. All used true
hybrid retrieval and the pinned CPU model, with zero agent exceptions, zero
evaluator exceptions, and zero invalid responses.

**Configuration T is the submission configuration.** The `Holdout status`
column separates a clean untouched holdout from an exploratory one, and the
reasoning behind choosing a configuration whose holdout is exploratory is set
out in [Retention decision](#retention-decision) below.

| Config | Dev HR@10 | Dev MRR | Dev MTTC | Dev Score | Holdout HR@10 | Holdout MRR | Holdout MTTC | Holdout Score | Holdout status |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| F, new state/policy | 0.941667 | 0.574018 | 3.133333 | 0.800372 | — | — | — | — | not opened at this commit |
| P, phrase rarity | 0.941667 | 0.639239 | 3.133333 | 0.819939 | 0.975000 | 0.644861 | 2.850000 | 0.843958 | clean |
| R, symmetric routing | 0.941667 | 0.651012 | 3.141667 | 0.823304 | 0.975000 | 0.652153 | 2.837500 | 0.846396 | clean |
| S, profile affinity | 0.941667 | 0.649610 | 3.133333 | 0.823050 | 0.975000 | 0.654653 | 2.850000 | 0.846896 | clean |
| Q, popularity prior | 0.941667 | 0.779722 | 3.133333 | 0.862083 | 0.975000 | 0.766071 | 2.850000 | 0.880321 | exploratory |
| **T, R+S+Q combined** | **0.941667** | **0.795913** | **3.141667** | **0.866774** | **0.975000** | **0.802932** | **2.837500** | **0.891630** | **exploratory** |
| U, expected question value | 0.941667 | 0.641323 | 3.175000 | 0.819730 | — | — | — | — | rejected on dev gate |
| V, facet population gate | 0.941667 | 0.639239 | 3.133333 | 0.819939 | — | — | — | — | tied P, not retained |

Q was selected on dev, where against P it improved 50 target ranks, regressed
none, and left 70 unchanged. HR@10 and MTTC were identical in every scenario.
Dev MRR rose from P to Q for Boundary (`0.7417` → `0.8889`),
Browsing (`0.6708` → `0.7760`), Buying (`0.6042` → `0.7948`), and Intent
Override (`0.6144` → `0.7130`). Q's later holdout row scored HR@10 `0.9750`,
MRR `0.7661`, MTTC `2.8500`, and TechnicalScore `0.8803`. Because the popularity
hypothesis followed an aggregate review of target rating counts across all 200
public sessions, that holdout result is exploratory, not statistically
untouched. A scenario-stratified paired bootstrap (10,000
resamples, seed 2026) estimates Q's dev TechnicalScore gain over P at
`0.042145`, with a 95% interval of `[0.030926, 0.054362]`.

Weighting the frozen dev and holdout aggregates by their 120/80 sample counts
gives an all-public estimate of HR@10 `0.955`, MRR `0.641488`, MTTC `3.02`,
and TechnicalScore `0.829546`, without rerunning or retuning on holdout.

| Scenario | Dev HR@10 | Dev MRR | Dev MTTC | Holdout HR@10 | Holdout MRR | Holdout MTTC |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Boundary | 1.0000 | 0.7417 | 4.1667 | 0.7500 | 0.1708 | 4.5000 |
| Browsing | 0.9792 | 0.6708 | 2.6458 | 1.0000 | 0.8001 | 2.6875 |
| Buying | 0.9167 | 0.6042 | 2.8958 | 1.0000 | 0.5501 | 2.1875 |
| Intent Override | 0.8889 | 0.6144 | 4.7222 | 0.9167 | 0.6417 | 4.5000 |

On dev, paired P-versus-F evaluation improved the target rank in 24 sessions
and regressed none, with identical HR/MTTC. A scenario-stratified paired
bootstrap (10,000 resamples, seed 2026) estimates the score gain at `0.019567`
with a 95% interval of `[0.010258, 0.029980]`.
Separate warm dev processes measured peak RSS of `1,527,340` KB for F and
`1,527,920` KB for P, a `580` KB increase.

### Retention decision

`T` is the submission configuration. It is the strongest measured candidate on
both splits, and the reasoning matters more than the number.

**Why an exploratory holdout does not disqualify it.** The competition
specification designates all 200 public sessions as development data and keeps
800 sessions private for grading. The 120/80 dev/holdout split used throughout
this repository is therefore a control this project imposed on itself, not a
competition requirement. `Q`'s popularity hypothesis followed an aggregate
review of target rating counts across all 200 public sessions, which relaxed
that self-imposed control, and the exploratory label records precisely where.
`T` inherits the label because `T` contains `Q`'s prior. What the label
constrains is the strength of the claim attached to the holdout number, not the
validity of the configuration itself.

**Why the downside is bounded.** HR@10 is identical for every configuration in
the table above, at `0.941667` on dev and `0.975000` on holdout. Each reranker
permutes order strictly inside the frozen Top-10 and never changes which
products are retrieved. A prior that fails to transfer to the private 800 can
therefore cost ranking position, but it cannot cost recall, and HR@10 carries
half the TechnicalScore weight.

**Why the gain looks structural rather than fitted.** `T`'s margin over `Q`
grew from `+0.004691` on dev to `+0.011309` on holdout, and on both splits it
concentrates in the same place: Browsing is flat to six decimal places, while
Intent Override gains `+0.026667` on dev and `+0.043333` on holdout. That is
`R`'s symmetric intent routing, which holds a clean holdout of its own. Two
independent splits agreeing on both the location and the direction of an effect
is the opposite of a result fitted to one of them.

**The clean-only alternative, stated plainly.** If an untouched holdout is
required, `S` is the best clean candidate at `0.846896`, with `R` just behind at
`0.846396`; both beat `P` with no caveat attached. Their margin is small — `S`
gains `0.002938` over `P` on holdout — and that is the honest trade. `S` is
clean but barely separable from `P`, while `T` is a large gain carrying a
disclosed caveat. This project reports both rather than only the one that
flatters it, and `tests/test_research_attribution.py` fails if any line quoting
an exploratory score omits the label.

## Ablation configurations

Select an ablation with `SHOPLENS_CONFIG`. An unset value selects the
submission configuration T; an unknown value still falls back safely to
baseline A. Hybrid configurations use the optional dense install when present
and degrade to BM25 when it is absent.

| Config | Change from the preceding build |
|---|---|
| A | BM25 plus clarification |
| B | Hybrid retrieval |
| C | Constraint scoring and session memory |
| D | C with session memory disabled |
| E | Candidate-facet information-gain clarification |
| F | Dynamic buying/browsing weights |
| G | Local cross-encoder reranker |
| H | Optional LLM rank experiment; offline path remains available |
| P | F plus membership-preserving phrase-rarity reranking |
| Q | P plus a bounded rating-count prior inside the frozen Top-10 |
| R | P plus precision retrieval routing for every hard-constraint intent, not Buying alone |
| S | P plus a bounded user-profile affinity prior inside the frozen Top-10 |
| T | R, S, and Q combined, to measure whether the three compose |
| U | P plus deterministic expected-question-value clarification |
| V | P plus catalog-population gating of clarification facets |
| Z | Clarification off, diagnostic only |

U is a documented research ablation, not a retained configuration. Its clean
dev run at `87834f4` kept HR@10 at `0.941667` and raised MRR from P's
`0.639239` to `0.641323`, but MTTC moved from `3.133333` to `3.175000`.
TechnicalScore therefore fell from `0.819939` to `0.819730` (`-0.000209`),
missing the pre-registered retention gate. U was rejected without opening
holdout; the reportable dev record remains in `results.jsonl`. U independently
adapts the paper's EVPI idea into a target-free expected Top-K posterior-mass
gain over catalog-facet answers. Sparse or missing facets and free-form answers
outside those catalog proxies limit what the score can represent.

V has now been **measured once on dev**. It is P with only clarification facet
eligibility changed: a facet is asked only when at least one candidate in the
live pool can answer it, with an unconditional fallback so the agent never
loses the ability to ask. The change is inert without a catalog and cannot
alter retrieval, scoring, or Top-10 membership. Its retention gate was frozen
in [the TDD record](docs/testing/facet-population-gate.tdd.md) before the run.
The reportable dev row at `547bdb1` tied P exactly at `0.819939` on every
metric, every scenario, and the turn count, so V cleared its gate only by a tie
and was not kept; holdout was never opened. The cause is measurable rather than
mysterious: the gate drops a facet only when no candidate in the pool carries
it, and `feature`, which is asked first, is populated on 99.43% of the
50,000-product catalog.

Q uses only the immutable organizer catalog. For each member of P's frozen
Top-10 it log-scales `rating_number` against the catalog maximum and adds
`0.15 * popularity / 61` to the existing P score. It then reorders those same
identifiers deterministically. The prior cannot change HitRate@10 or MTTC; it
is an ordering aid, never a retrieval filter or a replacement for
disclosed-constraint evidence.

The evaluator reports HR@10, MRR, MTTC, efficiency, the recommended composite,
and the same metrics per scenario. Changes should be retained only after gains
on both dev and holdout without a severe scenario regression.

The policy reads immutable catalog facets for the live candidate pool without
expanding the frozen `Candidate` contract. G still requires a specific vendored
cross-encoder that the plan does not name; H remains conditional on a specified
provider. Neither is claimed as completed.

## Cost, latency, and network disclosure

Configs A–G, P, Q, and U use zero prompt tokens, zero completion tokens, and no
paid service, so their model cost is $0. They run fully offline after the
catalog and selected local dependencies are present. Experimental results
remain subject to their stated retention gates.

## Limitations

- Catalog metadata is sparse and inconsistent. In particular, color is absent
  from more than half of products, so color has a weaker penalty than material.
- The deterministic parser targets the organizer's controlled templates and
  common free-form terms; it is not a general natural-language understanding model.
- The `other` clarification value is a simulator wildcard. ShopLens asks it at
  most once and otherwise selects a discriminative, non-declined facet.
- Aggregate profiles contain limited independent signal; they are ingested but
  do not override explicit within-session preferences.
- Q's rating-count prior favors established products and can disadvantage
  niche or newly listed products. It is log-bounded, applies only after Top-10
  membership is frozen, and never substitutes popularity for relevance.
- Public target construction strongly favors products with many ratings, so
  Q may overfit that benchmark prior even though its coefficient is dev-only.
- Facet extraction is deliberately shallow and deterministic; it cannot infer
  every latent product attribute from sparse free-form metadata.
- The dense model is vendored. The cross-encoder is not specified by the plan;
  if it is absent, G preserves the incoming order without an online download.
- There is no image input, external vector database, cross-session profiling,
  catalog mutation, or full-parameter model training.
